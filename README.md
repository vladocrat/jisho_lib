# Jisho_lib

## !IN DEVELOPMENT 
-----
This is a web scrapping lib for accessing [jisho.org](https://jisho.org/). Since they don't have any public API's and I kinda wanted to use their massive dictionary for a quick desktop access.

## Dependencies
-----

This lib is written in:

* C++17
* Qt 5.15.2
* Cmake 3.14
